 	<h1>Hello, I'm Clémence 💐</h1>
     <img src="images/profile.jpeg" class="img-circle" width="300px" alt="Clémence Trin">
     <p>
     I am an 18 yo french girl who loves hanging out with my friends in Paris and party when I have no exam to revise 🤓. I also like traveling, fashion and makeup ! Later, I would like to work in the luxury sector, either in France 🇫🇷, Spain 🇪🇸 or Italy 🇮🇹 ! I recently joined ESSEC Busniess School 🎓 as a BBA student, following the English Track in Cergy.

 	<h2>🎉 Party 🎉</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you have to take a break, have fun and not put too much pressure on yourself. This is one of the things I love to do at ESSEC : PARTY. It's always exciting to meet new people during parties and enjoy your evening with your friends 🍹🕺.

	<h2>💃 Dance 💃</h2>
    <p>
     I love dancing. I have been doing contemporary dance for 13 years, classic dance for 2 years and I practiced a little bit of modern jazz. Now that I'm at ESSEC, I don't really have the time to practice contemporary dance, so I am starting dance heels with a new friend 😝.

 	<h2>🛩 Traveling 🛩</h2>
    <p>
      I didn't have lots of opportunities to travel but I love it. For now, I have been to Switzerland, England, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Malta. I would love to go either to Spain or Italy for my studies. The country I really would love to visit is probably Greece or Egypt 🌅 !!

	<h2>👠 Fashion 👠</h2>
    <p>
     I love modeling and the fashion industry. I like to wear good outfits at school, even with heels sometimes. I will be doing my next internship at Dior Maroquinerie at Le Bon Marché and am super excited to start this journey in the workplace !

	<h2>💄 Makeup 💄</h2>
    <p>
     I started makeup when I was 12 and I love it ! It is a way to express your creativity and to take care of yourself. To me the best part of makeup is when I do my morning makeup routine 💋💋.
